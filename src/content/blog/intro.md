Hello, my name is Logan Bunch and I have decided relatively late in life to shift to a career in software. While I am starting off with front-end web development, I plan to dive into as many sectors of software engineering as my little brain can handle.

# What is this blog about?
I don't necessarily want to restrict the scope of this blog, but I intend to post updates on my learning. Perhaps I will venture into tutorials or simply pieces of advice where I feel my perspective may be appreciated. As my knowledge expands, I may include commentary on new technologies or current events in the field.
