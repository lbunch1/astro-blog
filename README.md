## My Blog

This is the current rendition of my blog. This site is hosted on github and deployed through Netlify and is live at [blog.logno.dev](https://blog.logno.dev/)

I created this site primarily because I wanted to explore the [Astro.build](https://astro.build/) framework.

To replicate this blog, you may clone this repository and run

```
npm install
```

To run a local test server run

```
npm run dev
```
